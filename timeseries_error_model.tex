\begin{abstract}
    Environmental time-series measurements are affected by time-varying errors
    arising from fouling, calibration drift, and instrument precision.
    We model these errors as continuous-time stochastic processes that evolve between
    maintenance events, when the measurement device is checked, cleaned, and recalibrated.
    Conditioning on the check measurements yields closed-form expressions for the
    expected error and its uncertainty, which can be used to bias-correct the
    time-series and construct confidence intervals.

%
Environmental monitoring often relies on in situ measurements 
collected over extended deployment periods.
In practice, these measurements are affected by time-varying error
from fouling and calibration drift,
as well as irreducible noise due to the precision of the measurement device.
Once deployed, fouling and drift accumulate, which biases the raw measurements.
To correct this bias, the device is checked periodically against known references.
Each check may quantify one or both error components and may involve cleaning or
recalibration, which resets the corresponding error to zero.

We model the fouling and drift as continuous-time Wiener processes between the check events.
The checks are also imprecise, so we treat them as noisy observations of the error processes.
The resulting expressions for the conditional mean and variance are equivalent to
Kalman filtering and smoothing for this system.
We show how to extend this framework to multi-point calibration procedures and 
to monitoring networks of similar devices.
The resulting methods provide transparent, analytically tractable estimates of
bias corrections and confidence intervals,
while remaining consistent with field practices for environmental monitoring.

\subsection{Preliminaries}
%
Let $X$ denote the true value of some variable
and let $Y$ denote its measured value.
The absolute error $E$ and percent error $\%E$ are given by
%
\begin{equation}
    E = Y - X
    \label{eq:absolute_error}
    \text{,}
\end{equation}
%
and
%
\begin{equation}
    \%E = 100 \times \frac{Y - X}{Y}
    \label{eq:percent_error}
    \text{,}
\end{equation}
%
so that $\%E$ is expressed as a percentage of the measured value.
For simplicity, we will instead work in terms of the fractional error
%
\begin{equation}
    \mathcal{E} = \frac{Y - X}{Y} = \frac{\%E}{100}
    \label{eq:fractional_error}
    \text{,}
\end{equation}
%
and only convert back to a percentage when needed.
Either scale (absolute or fractional) may be used for uncertainty quantification,
depending on the characteristics of the measurement device.

We assume that the measurement error has three components---
fouling $E_f$, calibration-drift $E_d$,
and instrument precision $E_p$---
that add on the absolute scale,
%
\begin{equation}
    E = E_f + E_d + E_p
    \text{.}
\end{equation}
%
On the fractional scale, these components combine multiplicatively,
%
\begin{equation}
    1 + \mathcal{E} = (1 + \mathcal{E}_f)(1 + \mathcal{E}_d)(1 + \mathcal{E}_p)
    \text{,}
\end{equation}
%
but for small errors (less than a few percent),
the relation is approximately additive,
%
\begin{equation}
    \mathcal{E} \approx \mathcal{E}_f + \mathcal{E}_d + \mathcal{E}_p
    \text{.}
\end{equation}
%

Fouling arises from physical, chemical, or biological buildup that biases the measurement.
It is assessed by taking check measurements immediately
before (subscript $b$) and after (subscript $a$) cleaning the device.
Under steady conditions,
the fouling error is given by
%
\begin{equation}
    E_f = Y_b - Y_a
    \text{,}
\end{equation}
%
where $Y_b$ and $Y_a$ are the measurements before and after cleaning, respectively.
If the environment changes during the cleaning,
then the fouling check must account for that change by using a reference device,
which measures the same environment during the cleaning period,
%
\begin{equation}
    E_f = (Y_b - Y_a) - (Z_b - Z_a)
    \qquad \text{or} \qquad
    \mathcal{E}_f = \frac{(Y_b - Y_a) - (Z_b - Z_a)}{Y_b}
    \label{eq:fouling_error}
    \text{,}
\end{equation}
%
where $Z_b$ and $Z_a$ are the before-and-after reference measurements
\citep[][noting they flip the sign of the error]{Wagner_2006}.

The calibration-drift represents any residual bias after cleaning the device,
which is measured by comparing a clean measurement against a known standard.
Let $Z_s$ be the standard value and let $Y_s$ be the clean measurement of $Z_s$.
Then the calibration-drift error is given by
%
\begin{equation}
    E_d = Y_s - Z_s
    \qquad \text{or} \qquad
    \mathcal{E}_{d} = \frac{Y_s - Z_s}{Y_s}
    \label{eq:drift_error}
    \qquad \text{\citep{Wagner_2006}.}
\end{equation}
%

Lastly, precision error $E_p$ represents irreducible measurement noise,
which is modeled using a Gaussian distribution,
%
\begin{equation}
    E_p \sim \mathcal{N}(0 ,\, \sigma_p^2)
    \qquad \text{or} \qquad
    \mathcal{E}_p \sim \mathcal{N}(0 ,\, \sigma_p^2)
    \text{,} \quad \text{where} \quad
    \sigma_p := \frac{\sigma_{\%p}}{100}
    \quad \text{for} \quad \mathcal{E}_p
    \label{eq:precision_error}
    \text{,}
\end{equation}
%
with variance given by
%
\begin{equation}
    v_p :=
    \operatorname{Var}[E_p] = \sigma_p^2
    \label{eq:precision_variance}
    \text{.}
\end{equation}
%
In practice, the precision is determined under controlled conditions
and reported in the device specifications
(sometimes called the "accuracy")
as the $2\sigma_p$ or 95\% confidence interval.
We typically assume fouling and drift errors have the same scale (absolute or relative)
as the precision, but this is not a requirement.

\subsection{Wiener-Process Error Model}

We model drift and fouling errors as a Wiener process
with an optional drift term $\mu$.
A Wiener process is a continuous-time stochastic process
with independent, normally distributed increments
whose variance grows linearly with elapsed time.
In particular, for a process $\{X_t\}_{t \ge 0}$
with drift $\mu$ and diffusion coefficient $\sigma$,
the increment over time $t$ satisfies
%
\begin{equation}
    X_t - X_0 \sim
    \mathcal{N}\!\left(\mu t,\; \sigma^2 t\right)
    \qquad \text{for } t \ge 0
    \qquad
    \text{\citep{Taylor_1998}.}
\end{equation}
%
The drift term $\mu$ represents the mean rate of change
(with $\mu=0$ for a classical Wiener process)
and is important for devices that exhibit systematic bias,
such as a device that gradually loses responsiveness
due to the degradation of a consumable component,
like a reagent in a colorimetric analyzer.

Let $E(t)$ denote the measurement error at time $t$,
modeled as a continuous-time stochastic process,
and let $e(t)$ denote a realization of this process.
Observations are available only at a finite set times
when fouling or calibration checks are performed,
$0 = t_0 < t_1 < \cdots < t_K = T$.
For notational convenience, we define
$E_k := E(t_k)$
and
$e_k := e(t_k)$.
Thus, $t_k - t_{k-1}$ denotes the elapsed time between successive error
observations $e_{k-1}$ and $e_k$.
Throughout, the subscript $k$ is used to index the error component---fouling
($f$) or calibration drift ($d$).

We first consider the period after observing the error at time $t_{k-1}$
but before observing the error at time $t_k$.
We refer to this as an ``open interval,'' which arises during real-time
uncertainty estimation.
In contrast, a ``closed interval'' is bracketed by observations at both
$t_{k-1}$ and $t_k$; in this case, the conditional mean and variance are
updated after incorporating the observation at $t_k$.

For an open interval,
the conditional distribution of the Wiener-process error is
%
\begin{equation}
    p(e_t \mid E_{k-1} = e_{k-1})
    =
    \mathcal{N}(m^o(t),\, v^o(t))
    \text{,} \qquad
    t > t_{k-1}
    %\mathcal{N}(\delta_{k-1}  e_{k-1} + \mu t ,\, \sigma^2 t)
\end{equation}
%
with conditional mean and variance given by
%
\begin{align}
    m^o(t) &:=
        \mathbb{E}\left[E_t \mid E_{k-1} = e_{k-1} \right]
        = \delta_{k-1} e_{k-1} + \mu (t - t_{k-1})
        \qquad \text{and}
        \label{eq:wiener_mean}\\
    v^o(t) &:=
        \operatorname{Var}\left[E_t \mid E_{k-1} = e_{k-1} \right]
        = \sigma^2 (t - t_{k-1})
        \label{eq:wiener_variance}
    \text{.}
\end{align}
%
where $\delta_{k-1}$ indicates whether the error process has been reset
due to cleaning or recalibration,
%
\begin{equation}
    \delta_{k-1} =
    \begin{cases}
        0, & \text{reset at } t_{k-1} \\
        1, & \text{otherwise}
    \end{cases}
    \text{,}
\end{equation}
%
$e_{k-1}$ is the error at time $t_{k-1}$,
%$\mathcal{N}$ is the normal distribution
%specified by its mean and variance,
$\mu$ is the drift rate (mean change per unit time),
$\sigma^2$ is the instantaneous variance rate (variance per unit time).
Thus for any $t \ge 0$,
it follows that the conditional mean and variance are
%
%
%
Later on, upon observing the error at time $t_k$,
the conditional distribution of $E_t$ is updated.
A Wiener process conditioned to start and end at specified values
is known as a Brownian bridge \citep{Taylor_1998}.
To simplify notation, 
let $\lambda(t)$ be the linear interpolation weight,
%
\begin{equation}
    \lambda_k(t) = \frac{t - t_{k-1}}{t_k - t_{k-1}}
    \text{,} \qquad
    k \in \{f, d\}
\end{equation}
%
such that $\lambda_f(t)$ denotes the fouling weight
for the interval $t \in \left[t_{f-1}, t_f \right]$.
The conditional distribution of the bridge at time
$t$ is
%
\begin{equation}
    p(e_t \mid E_{t_{k-1}} = e_{k-1},\, E_{t_k} = e_k)
    =
    \mathcal{N} \left(
        m^c(t), v^c(t)
        %\delta_{k-1} \left( 1 - \lambda(t) \right)e_{k-1}
        %+ 
        %\lambda(t) e_k,\;
        %\sigma^2 (1 - \lambda(t)) \lambda(t) (t_k - t_{k-1})
    \right)
    \text{,} \qquad
    t \in \left[t_{k-1},\, t_k \right]
\end{equation}
%
with conditional mean and variance given by
%
\begin{align}
    m^c(t) &:=
        \mathbb{E}\left[ E_t \mid E_{t_{k-1}} = e_{k-1} ,\, E_{t_k} = e_k \right]
        =
        \delta_{k-1} \left( 1 - \lambda(t) \right) e_{k-1} + \lambda(t) e_k
        \qquad \text{and}
        \label{eq:bridge_mean} \\
    v^c(t) &:=
    \operatorname{Var} \left[ E_t \mid E_{t_{k-1}} = e_{k-1} ,\, E_{t_k} = e_k \right]
        = \sigma^2 \frac{(t - t_{k-1})(t_{k} - t)}{t_{k} - t_{k-1}} 
        % = \sigma^2 (1 - \lambda_k(t)) (t - t_{k-1})
        \label{eq:bridge_variance}
    \text{.}
\end{align}
%
Let $\lambda^+_k(t)$ be the linear interpolation weight,
extended by
%
\begin{equation}
    \lambda^+_k(y) :=
    \begin{cases}
        1, & t < t_{1} \\
        \frac{t - t_{k-1}}{t_k - t_{k-1}}, & t \in [t_{k-1}, t_k] \\
        0, & t > t_{K}
    \end{cases}
    \text{,}
\end{equation}
%
such that $\lambda^+_k(t) = 1$ or $0$ when extrapolating
below or above the standard range, respectively.
Also let $\phi^+_k(t)$ define the bridge factor, extended by
%
\begin{equation}
    \phi^+_k(t) :=
    \begin{cases}
        (t_{1} - t), & t < t_{1} \\
        \frac{(t - t_{k-1})(t_{k} - t)}{(t_{k} - t_{k-1})},
        & t \in [t_{k-1}, t_{k}] \\
        (t - t_{K}), & t > t_{K} 
    \end{cases}
    \text{.}
\end{equation}
%
By substituting these definitions into the equations for the mean and covariance,
the open and closed forms become equivalent,
%
\begin{align}
    m_k(t) &= \delta_{k-1} \left( 1 - \lambda^+_k(t) \right)e_{k-1} + \lambda^+_k(t) e_k
    \label{eq:unified_wiener_mean}
    \qquad \text{and} \qquad \\
    v_k(t) &= \sigma^2 \phi^+_k(t)
    \label{eq:unified_wiener_variance}
    \text{,}
\end{align}
%
thereby eliminating the need for superscripts ($m^o$, $m^c$, etc.).

\subsection{Check-Measurement Uncertainty}

Recall that the checks measurements have their own uncertainty, which must be propagated through the error model.
We will explain the general statistical procedure, then apply it to fouling and calibration-drift.

Formally, we define a Gaussian bridge with uncertain endpoints,
where the expectation and variance of the endpoints is given by
%
\begin{equation}
    \mathbb{E}\left[ E_{k-1}\right] = m_{k-1}
    \text{,} \qquad
    \mathbb{E}\left[ E_{k}\right] = m_{k}
    \text{,} \qquad
    \operatorname{Var}\left[ E_{k-1}\right] = v_{k-1}
    \text{,} \qquad
    \operatorname{Var}\left[ E_{k}\right] = v_{k}
    \text{,} \qquad
    \operatorname{Cov}\left[ E_{k-1}, E_{k}\right] = 0
\end{equation}
%
The Gaussian bridge is given by 
%
\begin{equation}
    E_t = (1 - \lambda^+_k(t)) E_{k-1} + \lambda^+_k(t) E_k + W_t
    \text{,} \qquad
    W_t \sim \mathcal{N}\left(0, \sigma^2 \phi^+_k(t)\right)
    \text{.}
\end{equation}
%
By linearity of expectation,
%
\begin{align}
    \mathbb{E}[E_t] &= (1 - \lambda^+_k(t)) \, \mathbb{E}[E_{k-1}]
                        + \lambda^+_k(t) \, \mathbb{E}[E_k] + \mathbb{E}[W_t]
                        \notag \\
                    &= (1 - \lambda^+_k(t)) m_{k-1} + \lambda^+_k(t) m_{k}
\end{align}
%
Because $W_t$ is independent of the endpoint errors $E_{k-1}$ and $E_k$,
the variance decomposes into separate terms.
Applying the variance formula for a linear combination yields
%
\begin{align}
    \operatorname{Var}[E_t]
        &= \operatorname{Var}[
            (1 - \lambda^+_k(t)) \, E_{k-1}
            +
            \lambda^+_k(t) \, E_{k}
            ]
            + \operatorname{Var}[W_t]
            &\text{(Appendix~\ref{sec:variance_linear_combination})}
            \notag \\
        &=  \underbrace{
            (1 - \lambda^+_k(t))^2 \, \operatorname{Var}[E_{k-1}]
            + \lambda^+_k(t)^2 \, \operatorname{Var}[E_{k}]
            }_{\tilde{v}_k(t)}
            + 
            \underbrace{\sigma^2 \phi^+_k(t)}_{v_k(t)}
    \label{eq:variance_uncertain_bridge}
    \text{,}
\end{align}
%
where $\tilde{v}_k(t)$ represents the contribution from check-measurement uncertainty,
\begin{equation}
    \tilde{v}_k(t) := 
        (1 - \lambda^+_k(t))^2 \, \operatorname{Var}[E_{k-1}]
        + \lambda^+_k(t)^2 \, \operatorname{Var}[E_{k}]
    \label{eq:check_variance}
    \text{.}
\end{equation}
%
Assuming the check-measurements have constant variance
$\operatorname{Var}[E_k]$,
the conditional variance at time $t$ is
%
\begin{equation}
    \tilde{v}_k(t) = \left(
                        (1 - \lambda^+_k(t))^2 + \lambda^+_k(t)^2
                      \right) \, \operatorname{Var}[E_k]
    \label{eq:check_constant_variance}
    \text{,}
\end{equation}
%
which simplifies further for the open interval
to $ \tilde{v}^o_k(t) = \operatorname{Var}[E_k]$.
The following sections derive expressions for
$\operatorname{Var}[E_f]$ and $\operatorname{Var}[E_d]$,
which substitute in the $\operatorname{Var}[E_k]$ term
of Equation~\ref{eq:check_constant_variance}.
Later, we will relax the constant-variance assumption,
and refer back to the full expression for the check variance
(Equation~\ref{eq:check_variance}).

\subsubsection{Fouling-Check Uncertainty}

For a fouling check, we assume the measuring $m$ and reference $r$
devices have known precisions $\sigma_p$ and $\sigma_r$, respectively,
and their errors are normally distributed and independent,
\begin{equation}
    E^{m} \sim \mathcal{N}\left(0,\, \sigma^2_p \right)
    \text{,} \qquad
    E^{r} \sim \mathcal{N}\left(0,\, \sigma^2_r \right)
    \text{,} \qquad
    E^{m} \perp E^{r}
    \text{.}
\end{equation}
%
Let $Y$ and $Z$ denote the primary and reference measurements,
and $Z$ their true values,
%
\begin{equation}
    Y = X^m + E^{m}
    \text{,} \qquad
    Z = X^r + E^{r}
\end{equation}
%
Substituting these back into the fouling error (Equation~\ref{eq:fouling_error})
gives
%
\begin{align}
    E_f &= (Y_b - Y_a) - (Z_b - Z_a) \notag \\
        &= \left((X^m_b + E^m_{b}) - (X^m_a + E^m_{a})\right)
           - \left((X^r_b + E^r_{b}) - (X^r_a + E^r_{a})\right) \notag \\
        &= (E^m_{b} - E^m_{a}) - (E^r_{b} - E^r_{a})
    \text{.}
\end{align}
%
By independence ($E^{m} \perp E^{r}$), the variance is
\begin{align}
    \operatorname{Var}[E_f]
        &= \operatorname{Var}[E^m_b - E^m_a]
          + \operatorname{Var}[E^r_b - E^r_a]
\end{align}
%
Furthermore, we assume the measuring device uses internal filtering
(e.g., time averaging),
so its error is perfectly correlated during the check,
%
\begin{equation}
    \operatorname{Corr} \left( E^{m}_{a},\, E^{m}_{b} \right) = 1
    \quad \Rightarrow \quad
    \operatorname{Var}[E^m_b - E^m_a] = 0
    \text{,}
\end{equation}
%
If the reference device also uses filtering,
then
\begin{equation}
    \operatorname{Corr}(E_{z_a},\, E_{z_b}) = 1 
    \quad \Rightarrow \quad
    \operatorname{Var}[E_f] = 0
    \text{;}
\end{equation}
otherwise, if its errors are independent,
then
\begin{equation}
    \operatorname{Corr}(E_{z_a},\, E_{z_b}) = 0
    \quad \Rightarrow \quad
    \operatorname{Var}[E_f]
    = \operatorname{Var}[E^r_b] + \operatorname{Var}[E^r_a]
    = 2 \sigma^2_r
    \text{.}
\end{equation}

\subsubsection{Calibration-Check Uncertainty}

For a calibration check, we assume the standard and measurement device have known precisions
$\sigma_s$ and $\sigma_p$, respectively,
and their errors are normally distributed and independent,
%
\begin{equation}
    E^{s} \sim \mathcal{N}\left(0,\, \sigma^2_s \right)
    \text{,} \qquad
    E^{m} \sim \mathcal{N}\left(0,\, \sigma^2_p \right)
    \text{,} \qquad
    E^{s} \perp E^{m}
    \text{.}
\end{equation}
%
Let $Y_s$ and $Z_s$ denote the measurement and standard values,
\begin{equation}
    Y_s = X_s + E^{m}
    \text{,} \qquad
    Z_s = X_s + E^{s}
    \text{.}
\end{equation}
%
Substituting these variables into the drift error
(Equation~\ref{eq:drift_error}) yields
%
\begin{equation}
    E_d = (X_s + E^m) - (X_s + E^s)
    \text{.}
\end{equation}
%
By independence ($E^{m} \perp E^{s}$), the variance is
%
\begin{equation}
    \operatorname{Var}[E_d]
        = \operatorname{Var}[E^m] + \operatorname{Var}[E^s]
        = \sigma^2_p + \sigma^2_s
    \text{.}
\end{equation}
%

\subsection{Multi-point Correction}

Sometimes multiple standards are used to calibrate the device.
For example, a pH meter might be calibrated against standards at pH 4, 7, and 10.
In that case, the expected drift-correction for a measurement is 
a linear interpolation between
the corrections for the two nearest standards \citep{Wagner_2006}.

Let $z_s$ denote the standard values for $s = 1, 2, \ldots, S$.
For a given check time $t_k$,
the error is determined at each standard value,
%
\begin{equation}
    E_{k,s} := E(t_k,\, z_s) = e_{k,s}
    \text{,} \qquad
    \forall s \in \{1, 2, \ldots, S\}
    \text{.}
\end{equation}
%
First, we consider the conditional distribution at the check time $t_{k}$,
which forms a bridge in the $y$ dimension.
%In the multi-point calibration,
Next, we will use that first bridge as the uncertain boundary condition
for the bridge in the time dimension.

Given check-measurement errors $e_{k,s-1}$ and $e_{k,s}$,
the conditional mean of the $y$-bridge at time $t_k$ is given by
%
\begin{align}
m_{k}(y) &:= \mathbb{E} \left[
                            E_{k,y}
                            \mid
                            E_{k,s-1} = e_{k,s-1},\,
                            E_{k,s} = e_{k,s}
                           \right]
            \notag \\
            &= (1 - \lambda^+_s(y)) \, \mathbb{E} [E_{k,s-1}]
             + \lambda^+_s(y) \, \mathbb{E} [E_{k,s}] \notag \\
            &= (1 - \lambda^+_s(y)) e_{k,s-1}
             + \lambda^+_s(y) e_{k,s}
\label{eq:y_bridge_mean}
\text{,}
\end{align}
%
which is a linear interpolation between the check-measurement errors.
%
The conditional variance of the $y$-bridge at time $t_k$ is
%
\begin{align}
    v_{k}(y) &:= \operatorname{Var} \left[
                            E_{k,y}
                            \mid
                            E_{k,s-1} = e_{k,s-1},\,
                            E_{k,s} = e_{k,s}
                            \right] \notag \\
               &= (1 - \lambda^+_s(y))^2 \, \operatorname{Var}[E_{k,s-1}]
                 + \lambda^+_s(y)^2 \, \operatorname{Var}[E_{k,s}]
                + \eta^2 \phi^+_{s}(y)
    \label{eq:y_bridge_variance}
    \text{,}
\end{align}
%
where $\eta$ is the diffusion coefficient in the $y$ dimension.

Next, let these mean and variance define the boundary conditions
(end points) for the time-bridge.
The conditional mean is given by
the bilinear interpolation between four check points,
$e_{k-1,s-1}$, $e_{k-1,s}$, $e_{k,s-1}$, and $e_{k,s}$,
denoted as the set
$\{e_{i,j}\}$ where $i\in\{k-1,k\}$ and $j\in\{s-1,s\}$.
%
\begin{align}
    m_k(t, y)
    &:=
    \mathbb{E}\left[
        E_{t,y}\,\mid\,
        \{\,E_{t_i,y_j}=e_{i,j}\,\}_{\,i\in\{k-1,k\},\, j\in\{s-1,s\}}
        \right] \notag \\
    &=
    (1-\lambda^+_k(t),\;\lambda^+_k(t))
    \begin{bmatrix}
        \delta_{k-1} e_{k-1,s-1} & \delta_{k-1} e_{k-1,s} \\
        e_{k,s-1}   & e_{k,s}
    \end{bmatrix}
    \begin{bmatrix}
        1-\lambda^+_s(y) \\
        \lambda^+_s(y)
    \end{bmatrix}
    \label{eq:multi_check_mean}
    \text{.}
\end{align}
%
Expanding the right-hand side yields
%
\begin{align}
    m_k(t,y)
    &=
    (1 - \lambda_k(t))(1 - \lambda_s(y)) \delta_{k-1} e_{k-1,s-1} \notag \\
    &\quad
    + (1 - \lambda_k(t)) \lambda_s(y) \delta_{k-1} e_{k-1,s} \notag \\
    &\quad
    + \lambda_k(t)(1 - \lambda_s(y)) e_{k,s-1} \notag \\
    &\quad
    + \lambda_k(t) \lambda_s(y) e_{k,s}
    \text{,}
\end{align}
%
which satisfies the conditions for the four check points,
%
\begin{align}
    m_k(t_{k-1}, y_{s-1}) &=  \delta_{k-1}e_{k-1,s-1} \text{,} \notag \\
    m_k(t_{k-1}, y_{s})   &=  \delta_{k-1}e_{k-1,s} \text{,} \notag \\
    m_k(t_{k}, y_{s-1})   &=  e_{k,s-1} \text{,} \notag \\
    m_k(t_{k}, y_{s})     &=  e_{k,s} \text{.}
\end{align}
%
To derive the conditional variance,
substitute the variance of the $y$-bridge
(Equation~\ref{eq:y_bridge_variance})
into the equation for a time bridge with uncertain endpoints
(Equation~\ref{eq:variance_uncertain_bridge})
\begin{align}
    \operatorname{Var}\left[
        E_{t,y}\,\mid\,
        \{\,E_{t_i,y_j}=e_{i,j}\,\}_{\,i\in\{k-1,k\},\, j\in\{s-1,s\}}
        \right]
    =  
    \underbrace{
        (1 - \lambda^+_k(t))^2 v_{k-1}(y)
        + \lambda^+_k(t)^2 v_k(y)
    }_{\tilde{v}_k(t,y)}
    + 
    \underbrace{\sigma^2 \phi^+_k(t)}_{v_k(t)}
\end{align}
%
where $\tilde{v}_k(t,y)$ represents the contribution from check-measurement uncertainty,
%
\begin{equation}
    \tilde{v}_k(t,y) :=
        \left((1 - \lambda^+_k(t))^2,\; \lambda^+_k(t)^2\right)
        \begin{bmatrix}
            \operatorname{Var}[E_{k-1,s-1}] & \operatorname{Var}[E_{k-1,s}] \\
            \operatorname{Var}[E_{k,s-1}]   & \operatorname{Var}[E_{k,s}]
        \end{bmatrix}
        \begin{bmatrix}
            (1 - \lambda^+_s(y))^2 \\
            \lambda^+_s(y)^2
        \end{bmatrix}
        + \left((1 - \lambda^+_k(t))^2 + \lambda^+_k(t)^2\right)\eta^2 \phi^+_s(y)
    \label{eq:multi_check_variance}
    \text{.}
\end{equation}
%

\subsection{Combined Error}

For each component $k\in\{f,d\}$,
we decompose the conditional variance into a process term
(bridge uncertainty) and a check-measurement term:
\begin{equation}
\operatorname{Var}\!\left[E_k\right] = v_k(t) + \tilde v_k(t),
\end{equation}
where the process-only variance is
$
v_k(t) := \sigma_k^2\,\phi_k^+(t),
$
and $\tilde v_k(t)$ is the variance from the check measurements propagated to time $t$
(Equations~\ref{eq:check_variance} or \ref{eq:multi_check_variance}).
% XXX

For absolute errors,
the combined conditional mean and variance are
%
\begin{align}
m(t) &=
    m_{f}(t)
    +
    m_{d}(t, y)
    \label{eq:total_mean}
    \qquad \text{and} \\
v(t) &=
    v_{f}(t)
    +
    \tilde{v}_{f}(t)
    +
    v_{d}(t)
    +
    \tilde{v}_{d}(t, y)
    +
    v_{p}
    \label{eq:total_variance}
    \text{,}
\end{align}
%
where $f$, $d$, and $p$ denote the fouling, drift, and precision components, respectively;
the means are given by Equations~
\ref{eq:unified_wiener_mean}
and
\ref{eq:multi_check_mean};
and the variances by Equations
\ref{eq:precision_variance},
\ref{eq:unified_wiener_variance},
\ref{eq:check_variance},
and
\ref{eq:multi_check_variance}.

For fractional errors,
the combined mean and variance are
%
\begin{align}
    m(t) &= (1+m_f)(1+m_d) - 1
    \qquad \text{and} \\
    v(t) &=
        \left(v_f + (1+m_f)^2\right)
        \left(v_d + (1+m_d)^2\right)
        \left(v_p + 1\right)
        - \left((1+m_f)(1+m_d)\right)^2

\subsection{Corrected Measurement and Confidence Interval}

At a fixed time $t$, recall the observation model $Y = X + E$.
Let $m(t)$ and $v(t)$ denote the mean and variance of $E$ at time $t$.
Treating $X$ as fixed and $E$ as independent measurement error,
the bias-corrected estimate of $X$ is
\begin{equation}
    x(t) := y - m(t),
\end{equation}
with an approximate $(1-\alpha)$ confidence interval
\begin{equation}
    \mathrm{CI} = x(t) \pm q_{1-\alpha/2}\sqrt{v(t)}.
\end{equation}

For fractional errors $\mathcal{E}$,
we use the observation model $Y = X(1+\mathcal{E})$.
Assuming $\mathcal{E}$ is independent of $Y$
with mean $m(t)$ and variance $v(t)$,
a bias-corrected estimate of $X$ is
\begin{equation}
x(t) := y\bigl(1-m(t)\bigr)
\text{,}
\end{equation}
%
with approximate confidence interval
%
\begin{equation}
\mathrm{CI} = x(t) \pm q_{1-\alpha/2}\,y\sqrt{v(t)}
\text{.}
\end{equation}
%

When measurement errors exceed 100\% and the measurand is strictly positive,
we also provide the log-multiplicitive error model
in Appendix~\ref{sec:log_multiplicative_error}.

\section{Parameter Estimation}

Let $r_k$ be the one-step-ahead residual and $u_k$ its conditional variance
%
\begin{align}
    r_k &= e_k - m^o_k(t_k) \\
    u_k &= v^o_k(t_k) + v_k + v_r
    \text{,}
\end{align}
%
where $v_k$ denotes the observation error variance at time $t_k$,
and $v_r$ denotes the observation error variance at the most recent reset event
(cleaning or recalibration).
The drift rate $\mu_k$ and diffusion coefficient $\sigma_k$
can be estimated by maximizing the log-likelihood function
%
\begin{equation}
    \ell(\mu_k, \sigma_k^2)
    =
    - \frac{1}{2} \sum_{k=1}^{K_i}
    \left[
        \log \left( u_k \right)
        +
        \frac{r_k^2}{u_k}
    \right]
    \text{.}
\end{equation}
%

For the special case of no observational uncertainty,
$v_k = v_r \equiv 0$,
the drift and diffusion parameters have closed-form maximum-likelihood estimators.
Specifically,
%
\begin{equation}
    \hat{\mu}_k = \frac{\sum_{k=1}^{K} e_k - \delta_{k-1} e_{k-1}}
                       {\sum_{k=1}^{K} (t_k - t_{k-1})}
\end{equation}
%
and
%
\begin{equation}
    \hat{\sigma}_k^2 = \frac{1}{K}{\sum_{k=1}^{K} \frac{r_k^2}{t_k - t_{k-1}}}
    \text{.}
\end{equation}
%
Beware that when observational uncertainty is ignored,
these estimators become ill-conditioned for short intervals,
because the denominator goes to zero
but the numerator does not when $t_k - t_{k-1} \rightarrow 0$.
% When a closed-form expression is preferred,
% the observational uncertainy can be included using the following
% truncated heuristic,
% %
% \begin{equation}
%     \hat{\sigma}^2  =  \frac{1}{K}{\sum_{k=1}^{K}
%                        \max
%                        \left(
%                         0, \,
%                         \frac{r_k^2 - v_k - v_r}
%                              {t_k - t_{k-1}}
%                        \right)
%                      }
%     \text{.}
% \end{equation}

For the multi-point calibration,
define residual and variance terms
%
\begin{align}
    r_{d,s} &:= e_{d,s} - e_{d,s-1} \\
    u_{d,s} &:= \eta^2 (z_{d,s} - z_{d,s-1})
                + v_{d,s} + v_{d,s-1}
    \text{,}
\end{align}
%
and estimate the diffusion rate parameter $\eta$
by maximizing the log-likelihood,
%
\begin{equation}
    \ell(\eta^2)
    =
    %-\frac{K_i}{2} \ln(2 \pi)
    - \frac{1}{2} \sum_{d=1}^{D} \sum_{s=2}^{S_d}
    \left[
        \log \left( u_{d,s} \right)
        +
        \frac{r_{d,s}^2}{u_{d,s}}
    \right]
    \text{,}
\end{equation}
where $S_d$ is the number of standards in the $d$-th calibration check.
This is necessary because in practice,
only some of the standards may be checked at a time.

Assuming no observational uncertainty,
$v_s = v_{s-1} \equiv 0$,
the closed-form of the estimator is
%
\begin{equation}
    \hat{\eta}^2 =
    \frac{1}{N}
    \sum_{d=1}^{D} \sum_{s=2}^{S_d}
    \frac{\left(e_{d,s} - e_{d,s-1}\right)^2}
         {z_s - z_{s-1}}
    \text{,}
\end{equation}
where $N = \sum_{d=1}^{D} (S_d - 1)$.
This estimator is better conditioned because
the calibration standards are separated in the $y$-dimension,
ensuring that the denominator never approaches zero.

%
\begin{equation}

\section{Combined mean and variance for independent fractional errors}
\label{sec:combined_fractional_proof}

Let $E_f$, $E_d$, and $E_p$ denote independent fractional-error components with
means $m_f,m_d,0$ and variances $v_f,v_d,v_p$, respectively, and define the
combined fractional error $E$ by
%
\begin{equation}
    1+E := (1+E_f)(1+E_d)(1+E_p).
\end{equation}
%
Then
%
\begin{equation}
    m := \mathbb{E}[E] = (1+m_f)(1+m_d)-1,
\end{equation}    
%
and
%
\begin{equation}
    v := \operatorname{Var}(E)
        =
        \left(v_f+(1+m_f)^2\right)
        \left(v_d+(1+m_d)^2\right)
        \left(v_p+1\right)
        -\left((1+m_f)(1+m_d)\right)^2.
\end{equation}
%

\paragraph{Proof.}
%
Let $A=1+E_f$, $B=1+E_d$, and $C=1+E_p$, so that $1+E=ABC$.
By independence,
%
\begin{equation}
    \mathbb{E}[ABC]=\mathbb{E}[A]\mathbb{E}[B]\mathbb{E}[C]
                   = (1+m_f)(1+m_d)\cdot 1,
\end{equation}
%
which implies $m=\mathbb{E}[E]=\mathbb{E}[ABC]-1=(1+m_f)(1+m_d)-1$.
%
Also by independence,
%
\begin{equation}
    \operatorname{Var}(ABC)=\mathbb{E}[A^2B^2C^2]-\mathbb{E}[ABC]^2
    =\mathbb{E}[A^2]\mathbb{E}[B^2]\mathbb{E}[C^2]-\mathbb{E}[ABC]^2
    \text{.}
\end{equation}
%
Using $\mathbb{E}[A^2]=\operatorname{Var}(A)+\mathbb{E}[A]^2=v_f+(1+m_f)^2$,
$\mathbb{E}[B^2]=v_d+(1+m_d)^2$, and $\mathbb{E}[C^2]=v_p+1$ (since
$\mathbb{E}[C]=1$), we obtain the stated expression for $v$.


\section{Log-multiplicative error model}
\label{sec:log_multiplicative_error}

For strictly positive variables,
we adopt a log-multiplicative error model.
Let $\varepsilon$ denote the measurement error
on the logarithmic scale, and assume the observation model
%
\begin{equation}
    Y = X \exp(\varepsilon),
\end{equation}
%
so that
%
\begin{equation}
    \log Y = \log X + \varepsilon.
\end{equation}
%
Here, $\varepsilon$ is dimensionless and represents the log-scale error,
given by
%
\begin{equation}
    \varepsilon_d = \log Y_s - \log Z_s = \log\!\left( \frac{Y_s}{Z_s} \right)
\end{equation}
%
for the drift and similarly, for the fouling,
%
\begin{equation}
    \varepsilon_f = \left( \log Y_b - \log Y_a \right) - \left( \log Z_b - \log Z_a \right)
    = \log\left( \frac{Y_b}{Y_a} \right) - \log\left( \frac{Z_b}{Z_a} \right)
\end{equation}

As before, the log-scale error $\varepsilon_t$ is modeled as a continuous-time
stochastic process with $m(t)$ and $v(t)$
denoting its conditional mean and variance,
except their components are additive in logarithmic space
(Equations~\ref{eq:total_mean} and \ref{eq:total_variance}).

Conditioning on the observation $Y = y$ and treating $X$ as fixed,
the conditional distribution of $\log X$ is
%
\begin{equation}
    \log X \mid Y = y
    \sim
    \mathcal{N}\!\left( \log y - m(t),\; v(t) \right).
\end{equation}
%

A bias-corrected point estimate of $X$ may be defined in two common ways.
First, the median of the implied lognormal distribution,
which is unbiased on the logarithmic scale, is given by
%
\begin{equation}
    x_{\mathrm{med}}(t)
    := \exp\!\left( \mathbb{E}\!\left[ \log X \mid Y = y \right] \right)
    = y \exp\!\bigl( -m(t) \bigr).
\end{equation}
%
Alternatively, the conditional mean of $X$ on the original scale is
%
\begin{equation}
    x_{\mathrm{mean}}(t)
    := \mathbb{E}\!\left[ X \mid Y = y \right]
    = y \exp\!\left( -m(t) + \tfrac{1}{2} v(t) \right),
\end{equation}
%
which includes the standard lognormal bias-correction term
$\tfrac{1}{2}v(t)$.

Under the Gaussian assumption for $\varepsilon$, an approximate
$(1-\alpha)$ confidence interval for $X$ is obtained from the quantiles of
the lognormal distribution,
%
\begin{equation}
    \mathrm{CI}
    =
    \left[
        x_{\mathrm{med}}(t)
        \exp\!\left( -q_{1-\alpha/2} \sqrt{v(t)} \right),
        \;
        x_{\mathrm{med}}(t)
        \exp\!\left(  q_{1-\alpha/2} \sqrt{v(t)} \right)
    \right],
\end{equation}
%
where $q_{1-\alpha/2}$ is the $(1-\alpha/2)$ quantile of the standard normal
distribution.

%% Regarding figures and tables in appendices, the following two options are possible depending on your general handling of figures and tables in the manuscript environment:

%% Option 1: If you sorted all figures and tables into the sections of the text, please also sort the appendix figures and appendix tables into the respective appendix sections.
%% They will be correctly named automatically.

%% Option 2: If you put all figures after the reference list, please insert appendix tables and figures after the normal tables and figures.
%% To rename them correctly to A1, A2, etc., please add the following commands in front of them:

\appendixfigures  %% needs to be added in front of appendix figures

\appendixtables   %% needs to be added in front of appendix tables

%% Please add \clearpage between each table and/or figure. Further guidelines on figures and tables can be found below.
