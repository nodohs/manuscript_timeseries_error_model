%
Environmental monitoring often relies on in situ measurements
collected over extended deployment periods.
In practice, these measurements can exhibit systematic errors
from fouling and calibration drift,
as well as irreducible noise.
Consequently, the measurement device must be periodically checked against known references,
cleaned, and recalibrated, which resets the systematic error to zero.
Later, the information from these checks is used to correct
the raw measurements by linearly interpolating errors
between check measurements \citep{Wagner_2006}.
This correction procedure is mathematically equivalent to modeling the error
as a Wiener process conditioned on the check measurements.
Following that assumption, we derive expressions for the conditional mean and variance,
which are equivalent to Kalman filtering and smoothing for this system.
As the checks are also imprecise,
their uncertainty is propagated into the time-series model.
Next, we extend the model to multipoint calibrations
and monitoring networks of similar devices.
The result is a transparent and tractable framework for estimating
fouling and drift corrections with confidence intervals
that is consistent with standard operating procedures for environmental monitoring.


\section{Preliminaries}
%
Let $X$ be the true value of some variable
and let $Y$ be its measured value,
then the measurement error $E$ is the difference
%
\begin{equation}
    E = Y - X
    \label{eq:absolute_error}
    \text{.}
\end{equation}
We assume the measurement error has three independent components---
fouling $E_f$, calibration drift $E_d$,
and measurement noise $E_m$---
that combine additively,
such that the total error is
%
\begin{equation}
    E = E_f + E_d + E_m
    \text{.}
\end{equation}
%
Fouling is any physical, chemical, or biological buildup on the measurement device
causing systematic error.
Under steady-state conditions,
fouling error is assessed by comparing measurements
taken immediately before and after cleaning the device,
%
\begin{equation}
    E_f = Y_b - Y_a
    \qquad \text{or} \qquad
    \mathcal{E}_f = \frac{Y_b - Y_a}{Y_b}
    \label{eq:fouling_error_simple}
    \text{,}
\end{equation}
%
where $Y_b$ and $Y_a$ are the before-and-after measurements, respectively.
Otherwise, a reference device is needed to adjust for any environmental change
during the cleaning process,
%
\begin{equation}
    E_f = (Y_b - Y_a) - (Z_b - Z_a)
    \label{eq:fouling_error}
    \qquad \text{\citep[][but opposite sign]{Wagner_2006},}
\end{equation}
%
where $Z_b$ and $Z_a$ are the before-and-after measurements
from a co-located reference device.
Note \citet{Wagner_2006} flips the sign of the error to equal the correction,
whereas we follow the convention in statistics.

Any systematic bias remaining after cleaning is attributed to calibration drift,
which is assessed by comparing a clean measurement against a known standard.
Let $Z_s$ be the standard value and let $Y_s$ be the clean measurement of $Z_s$,
then the calibration drift error is given by
%
\begin{equation}
    E_d = Y_s - Z_s
    \label{eq:drift_error}
    \qquad \text{\citep[][but opposite sign]{Wagner_2006}.}
\end{equation}
%

Finally, any residual error after cleaning and recalibrating the device
is attributed to measurement noise,
which is modeled as a Gaussian distribution,
%
\begin{equation}
    E_m \sim \mathcal{N}(0 ,\, \sigma_m^2)
    \label{eq:measurement_error}
    \text{,}
\end{equation}
%
where $\sigma_m$ denotes the measurement-device precision,
and the variance of the measurement error is
%
\begin{equation}
    v_m :=
    \operatorname{Var}[E_m] = \sigma_m^2
    \label{eq:measurement_variance}
    \text{.}
\end{equation}
%
In practice, the measurement precision is determined under controlled conditions
and reported in the device specifications
(sometimes called the ``accuracy'')
as the $2\sigma_m$ or 95\% confidence interval.

TODO Here we need to introduce the percent or absolute, whichever is greater precision
and explain that we won' work on the percent scale because it 
% Each error component can be modeled on either scale---absolute or fractional---
% but we typically assume whatever scale was specified for the precision.

\section{Wiener-Process Error Model}

Let $E(t)$ denote the measurement error at time $t$, 
and let $e(t)$ denote its realization.
Observations are available for a finite set of times
when fouling or calibration are checked,
$t_0 < t_1 < \cdots < t_K$.
For notational convenience, we define
$E_k := E(t_k)$
and
$e_k := e(t_k)$.
Thus, $t_k - t_{k-1}$ denotes the time elapsed between successive error
observations $e_{k-1}$ and $e_k$.
Throughout, the index $k$ will be substituted with $f$ and $d$
to denote fouling and calibration-drift checks, respectively.

We assume the fouling or calibration-drift error evolve as a continuous-time
stochastic process, defined by
%
\begin{equation}
    E_t = \delta_{k-1} E_{k-1} + \mu (t - t_{k-1}) + \sigma W_t
    \text{,}
\end{equation}
%
where $\delta_{k-1}$ indicates whether the error process was reset during the previous check
(because the device was cleaned or recalibrated),
%
\begin{equation}
    \delta_{k-1} =
    \begin{cases}
        0, & \text{reset at } t_{k-1} \\
        1, & \text{otherwise}
    \end{cases}
    \text{,}
\end{equation}
%
%$e_{k-1}$ is the error at time $t_{k-1}$,
%$\mathcal{N}$ is the normal distribution
%specified by its mean and variance,
$\mu$ is the ``drift'' rate (mean change per unit time),
$\sigma$ is the ``diffusion'' rate,
and $W_t$ is a standard Wiener process,
%
\begin{equation}
    W_t \sim \mathcal{N}(0,\, t - t_{k-1})
    \qquad \text{\citep{Taylor_1998}.}
\end{equation}
%
The drift term $\mu$ represents the mean rate of change
and is important for devices that gradually lose responsiveness due
to the degradation of their components over time,
like the chemical degradation of reagents in a colorimetric analyzer.

The timeseries $E_t$ is subdivided into intervals that are bracketed by check measurements.
An interval bracketed by a single check is called ``open.''
For example, the interval after the last check ($t > t_K$) is open until
the next check occurs sometime in the future ($t_{K+1}$).
In contrast, a ``closed'' interval is bracketed by checks at both ends ( $ t \in [t_{k-1}, t_k]$ ).
In real-time monitoring, the present time is always within an open interval.
Once the next check is recorded, that interval is closed and a new open interval begins.

For an open interval,
the conditional distribution of the fouling or calibration-drift error is
%
\begin{equation}
    p(e_t \mid E_{k-1} = e_{k-1})
    =
    \mathcal{N}(m_k^o(t),\, v_k^o(t))
    \text{,} \qquad
    t > t_{k-1}
    %\mathcal{N}(\delta_{k-1}  e_{k-1} + \mu t ,\, \sigma^2 t)
\end{equation}
%
with conditional mean and variance given by
%
\begin{align}
    m_k^o(t) &:=
        \mathbb{E}\left[E_t \mid E_{k-1} = e_{k-1} \right]
        = \delta_{k-1} e_{k-1} + \mu (t - t_{k-1})
        \qquad \text{and}
        \label{eq:wiener_mean}\\
    v_k^o(t) &:=
        \operatorname{Var}\left[E_t \mid E_{k-1} = e_{k-1} \right]
        = \sigma^2 (t - t_{k-1})
        \label{eq:wiener_variance}
    \text{.}
\end{align}
%

Upon observing the error at time $t_k$,
the conditional distribution of $E_t$ is updated and the interval is closed.
A Wiener process conditioned to start and end at specified values
is called a Brownian bridge \citep{Taylor_1998}.
To simplify notation, let $\lambda_k(t)$ be the linear-interpolation weight,
%
\begin{equation}
    \lambda_k(t) = \frac{t - t_{k-1}}{t_k - t_{k-1}}
    \text{,} \qquad
    t \in [t_{k-1}, t_k]
    \text{.}
\end{equation}
%
The conditional distribution of the bridge at time $t$ is
%
\begin{equation}
    p(e_t \mid E_{t_{k-1}} = e_{k-1},\, E_{t_k} = e_k)
    =
    \mathcal{N} \left(
        m^c(t),\, v^c(t)
        %\delta_{k-1} \left( 1 - \lambda(t) \right)e_{k-1}
        %+ 
        %\lambda(t) e_k,\;
        %\sigma^2 (1 - \lambda(t)) \lambda(t) (t_k - t_{k-1})
    \right)
    \text{,} \qquad
    t \in \left[t_{k-1},\, t_k \right]
\end{equation}
%
with conditional mean and variance given by
%
\begin{align}
    m_k^c(t) &:=
        \mathbb{E}\left[ E_t \mid E_{t_{k-1}} = e_{k-1} ,\, E_{t_k} = e_k \right]
        =
        \delta_{k-1} \left( 1 - \lambda_k(t) \right) e_{k-1} + \lambda_k(t) e_k
        \qquad \text{and}
        \label{eq:bridge_mean} \\
    v_k^c(t) &:=
    \operatorname{Var} \left[ E_t \mid E_{t_{k-1}} = e_{k-1} ,\, E_{t_k} = e_k \right]
        = \sigma^2
        \underbrace{
            \frac{(t - t_{k-1})(t_{k} - t)}{t_{k} - t_{k-1}} 
        }_{\text{bridge factor}}
        % = \sigma^2 (1 - \lambda_k(t)) (t - t_{k-1})
        \label{eq:bridge_variance}
    \text{.}
\end{align}
%
Extending $\lambda_k(t)$ as
%
\begin{equation}
    \lambda^+_k(t) :=
    \begin{cases}
        1, & t < t_{1} \\
        \frac{t - t_{k-1}}{t_k - t_{k-1}}, & t \in [t_{k-1}, t_k] \\
        0, & t > t_{K}
    \end{cases}
    \text{,}
\end{equation}
%
so $\lambda^+_k(t) = 1$ or $0$ for open intervals,
and letting $\phi^+_k(t)$ be the bridge factor, extended by
%
\begin{equation}
    \phi^+_k(t) :=
    \begin{cases}
        (t_{1} - t), & t < t_{1} \\
        \frac{(t - t_{k-1})(t_{k} - t)}{(t_{k} - t_{k-1})},
        & t \in [t_{k-1}, t_{k}] \\
        (t - t_{K}), & t > t_{K} 
    \end{cases}
    \text{.}
\end{equation}
and letting $\zeta^+_k(t)$ be a drift factor, extended by
%
\begin{equation}
    \zeta^+_k(t) :=
    \begin{cases}
        (t_{1} - t), & t < t_{1} \\
        0 , & t \in [t_{k-1}, t_{k}] \\
        (t - t_{K}), & t > t_{K}
    \end{cases}
    \text{,}
\end{equation}
so the drift term is negated during closed intervals.
%
Then conditional mean and variance can be written without superscripts
($m^o$, $m^c$, etc.) as
%
\begin{align}
    m_k(t)  &=  \delta_{k-1} \left( 1 - \lambda^+_k(t) \right)e_{k-1}
                + \lambda^+_k(t) e_k
                + \mu \zeta^+_k(t)
    \label{eq:unified_wiener_mean}
    \qquad \text{and} \qquad \\
    v_k(t) &= \sigma^2 \phi^+_k(t)
    \label{eq:unified_wiener_variance}
    \text{.}
\end{align}

\section{Check-Measurement Uncertainty}

Noise in the check measurements contributes additional uncertainty to the error process.
After reviewing the general approach for propagating check-measurement uncertainty,
we derive formulas for fouling and calibration-drift checks.

For a bridge with uncertain endpoints,
the endpoint expectations and variances are defined as
%
\begin{equation}
    m_{k}(t_{k-1}) := \mathbb{E}\left[ E_{k-1}\right]
    \text{,} \qquad
    m_{k}(t_k) := \mathbb{E}\left[ E_{k}\right]
    \text{,} \qquad
    v_{k}(t_{k-1}) := \operatorname{Var}\left[ E_{k-1}\right]
    \text{,} \qquad
    v_k(t_k) := \operatorname{Var}\left[ E_{k}\right]
\end{equation}
%
Given the Brownian-bridge
%
\begin{equation}
    E_t = (1 - \lambda^+_k(t)) E_{k-1} + \lambda^+_k(t) E_k + \sigma W_t
    \text{,} \qquad
    W_t \sim \mathcal{N}\left(0, \phi^+_k(t)\right)
    \text{.}
\end{equation}
%
Applying linearity of the expectation,
%
\begin{align}
    \mathbb{E}[E_t] &= (1 - \lambda^+_k(t)) \, \mathbb{E}[E_{k-1}]
                        + \lambda^+_k(t) \, \mathbb{E}[E_k] + \mathbb{E}[W_t]
                        \notag \\
                    &= (1 - \lambda^+_k(t)) m_{k}(t_{k-1}) + \lambda^+_k(t) m_{k}(t_k)  
    \text{,}
\end{align}
%
shows that the conditional mean remains a linear interpolation between the endpoint means,
regardless of the endpoint variances.

Since $W_t$ is independent of $E_{k-1}$ and $E_k$,
the combined variance is obtained by applying the variance formula for a linear combination,
%
\begin{align}
    \operatorname{Var}[E_t]
        &= \operatorname{Var}[
            (1 - \lambda^+_k(t)) \, E_{k-1}
            +
            \lambda^+_k(t) \, E_{k}
            ]
            + \operatorname{Var}[W_t]
            \notag \\
        &=  \underbrace{
            (1 - \lambda^+_k(t))^2 \, v_{k}(t_{k-1})
            + \lambda^+_k(t)^2 \, v_k(t_k)
            }_{\tilde{v}_k(t)}
            + 
            \underbrace{\sigma^2 \phi^+_k(t)}_{v_k(t)}
    \label{eq:variance_uncertain_bridge}
    \text{,}
\end{align}
%
where $\tilde{v}_k(t)$ is the contribution from check-measurement uncertainty.
If the endpoint errors have equal variance,
$v_{k}(t_{k-1}) = v_{k}(t_k)$,
the conditional variance simplifies to
%
\begin{equation}
    \tilde{v}_k(t) = \left(
                        (1 - \lambda^+_k(t))^2 + \lambda^+_k(t)^2
                      \right) \, v_{k}(t_k)
    \label{eq:check_constant_variance}
    \text{.}
\end{equation}
%
For open intervals, this reduces to
$ \tilde{v}^o_k(t) = v_{k}(t_{k-1})$,
which is constant in time.

The next sections derive variance formula for the
fouling and calibration-drift checks,
$v_{f}(t_f)$ and $v_{d}(t_d)$,
to use in Equation~\ref{eq:check_constant_variance}.
Later, we introduce multipoint calibrations,
where the check variances often differ;
so we will use Equation~\ref{eq:check_variance} for that case.

\subsection{Fouling-Check Uncertainty}

For a fouling check, the measurement $m$ and reference $r$
devices have known precisions $\sigma_m$ and $\sigma_r$
and normally distributed, independent errors,
\begin{equation}
    E^{m} \sim \mathcal{N}\left(0,\, \sigma^2_m \right)
    \text{,} \qquad
    E^{r} \sim \mathcal{N}\left(0,\, \sigma^2_r \right)
    \text{,} \qquad
    E^{m} \perp E^{r}
    \text{.}
\end{equation}
%
Let $Y$ and $Z$ be the principal and reference measurements,
and let $X^m$ and $X^r$ be their respective true values,
%
\begin{equation}
    Y = X^m + E^{m}
    \text{,} \qquad
    Z = X^r + E^{r}
    \text{.}
\end{equation}
%
The superscripts are necessary because $X$
depends on the calibration of either device.
Substituting back into the fouling error (Equation~\ref{eq:fouling_error})
gives
%
\begin{align}
    E_f &= (Y_b - Y_a) - (Z_b - Z_a) \notag \\
        &= \left((X^m_b + E^m_{b}) - (X^m_a + E^m_{a})\right)
           - \left((X^r_b + E^r_{b}) - (X^r_a + E^r_{a})\right) \notag \\
        &= (E^m_{b} - E^m_{a}) - (E^r_{b} - E^r_{a})
    \text{.}
\end{align}
%
By independence ($E^{m} \perp E^{r}$), the variance of the fouling check is
\begin{align}
    \operatorname{Var}[E_f]
        &= \operatorname{Var}[E^m_b - E^m_a]
          + \operatorname{Var}[E^r_b - E^r_a]
    \text{.}
\end{align}
%
If the measurement device uses internal filtering
(e.g., time averaging),
we assume its errors are perfectly correlated during the check,
such that the before-and-after errors cancel and the check variance is zero,
%
\begin{equation}
    \operatorname{Corr} \left[ E^{m}_{a},\, E^{m}_{b} \right] = 1
    \quad \Rightarrow \quad
    \operatorname{Var}[E_f] =
    \operatorname{Var} \left[E^m_b - E^m_a\right] = 0
    \text{.}
\end{equation}
%
Similarly, for the reference device, if it also uses filtering.
Otherwise, we assume its errors are independent,
and the check variance is given by
%
\begin{equation}
    \operatorname{Corr}\left[E^{r}_a,\, E^{r}_b\right] = 0
    \quad \Rightarrow \quad
    \operatorname{Var} \left[E_f\right]
    = \operatorname{Var} \left[E^r_b\right] + \operatorname{Var}\left[E^r_a\right]
    = \sigma^2_r + \sigma^2_r = 2 \sigma^2_r
    \text{.}
\end{equation}
%
Therefore, the fouling-check variance is either zero or $2 \sigma^2_r$,
depending on the error correlation of the reference device.

\subsection{Calibration-Check Uncertainty}

For a calibration check, 
the standard and measurement have known precisions $\sigma_s$ and $\sigma_m$
and independent errors,
%
\begin{equation}
    E^{s} \sim \mathcal{N}\left(0,\, \sigma^2_s \right)
    \text{,} \qquad
    E^{m} \sim \mathcal{N}\left(0,\, \sigma^2_m \right)
    \text{,} \qquad
    E^{s} \perp E^{m}
    \text{.}
\end{equation}
%
Let $Y_s$ and $Z_s$ be the measurement and the standard,
and let $X_s$ be the true value of the standard, such that
%
\begin{equation}
    Y_s = X_s + E^{m}
    \text{,} \qquad \text{and} \qquad
    Z_s = X_s + E^{s}
    \text{.}
\end{equation}
%
Substituting back into the drift error
(Equation~\ref{eq:drift_error}) gives
%
\begin{equation}
    E_d = (X_s + E^m) - (X_s + E^s)
    \text{,}
\end{equation}
%
and by independence ($E^{m} \perp E^{s}$), the variance of the drift check is
%
\begin{equation}
    \operatorname{Var}[E_d]
        = \operatorname{Var}[E^m] + \operatorname{Var}[E^s]
        = \sigma^2_m + \sigma^2_s
    \text{.}
\end{equation}

\section{Multipoint Calibration Check}

In a multipoint calibration check, a device is checked against multiple standards
that should span the expected range of the measurand.
Multipoint calibrations are essential when the device response is nonlinear
and the magnitude of drift varies across the measurement range.
For example, a pH meter might be calibrated using standards at pH 4, 7, and 10.
The drift correction is determined by linearly
interpolating errors between each check value
\citep{Wagner_2006}.

The previous sections showed how single-point checks form a Gaussian bridge through time.
The multipoint check extends the same basic idea,
using the check measurements as boundary conditions for the bridge.
In this case, the boundary condition is not a point but a second bridge between the standards in the $y$ dimension.

Let $z_s$ denote the standard values for $s = 1, 2, \ldots, S$,
let $E_{k,s} := E(t_k,\, z_s)$ be the error at time $t_k$ and standard $z_s$,
and let $e_{k,s}$ be its realization.
Given check-measurement errors $e_{k,s-1}$ and $e_{k,s}$,
the conditional mean of the $y$-bridge at time $t_k$ is given by
%
\begin{align}
m_{k}(y) &:= \mathbb{E} \left[
                            E_{k,y}
                            \mid
                            E_{k,s-1} = e_{k,s-1},\,
                            E_{k,s} = e_{k,s}
                           \right]
            \notag \\
            &= (1 - \lambda^+_s(y)) \, \mathbb{E} [E_{k,s-1}]
             + \lambda^+_s(y) \, \mathbb{E} [E_{k,s}] \notag \\
            &= (1 - \lambda^+_s(y)) e_{k,s-1}
             + \lambda^+_s(y) e_{k,s}
\label{eq:y_bridge_mean}
\text{,}
\end{align}
%
which is a linear interpolation between the check-measurement errors.
Unlike the time-bridge, the $y$-bridge has no drift or reset terms ($\delta$, $\mu$).
The conditional variance of the $y$-bridge at time $t_k$ is
%
\begin{align}
    v_{k}(y)    &:= \operatorname{Var} \left[
                            E_{k,y}
                            \mid
                            E_{k,s-1} = e_{k,s-1},\,
                            E_{k,s} = e_{k,s}
                            \right] \notag \\
                &= (1 - \lambda^+_s(y))^2 \, \operatorname{Var}[E_{k,s-1}]
                    + \lambda^+_s(y)^2 \, \operatorname{Var}[E_{k,s}]
                    + \eta^2 \phi^+_{s}(y)
    \label{eq:y_bridge_variance}
    %\text{(Equation \ref{eq:variance_uncertain_bridge} adapted for the $y$ dimension),}
\end{align}
%
where $\eta$ is the diffusion coefficient in the $y$ dimension,
and $\operatorname{Var}[E_{k,s-1}]$ and $\operatorname{Var}[E_{k,s}]$
are the variances of the checks against standards $s-1$ and $s$.

Under this boundary condition,
the conditional mean is a bilinear interpolation
between four check points,
$e_{k-1,s-1}$, $e_{k-1,s}$, $e_{k,s-1}$, and $e_{k,s}$.
Let $\mathcal{C}$ denote the set of four check errors,
%
\begin{equation}
    \mathcal{C} := \{E_{k-1,s-1} = e_{k-1,s-1},\, E_{k-1,s} = e_{k-1,s},\, 
    E_{k,s-1} = e_{k,s-1},\, E_{k,s} = e_{k,s}\}
    \text{,}
\end{equation}
then the conditional mean is given by
%
\begin{align}
    m_k(t, y)
    &:=
    \mathbb{E}\left[
        E_{t,y}\,\mid\,
        \mathcal{C}
        \right] \notag \\
    &=
    (1-\lambda^+_k(t),\;\lambda^+_k(t))
    \begin{bmatrix}
        \delta_{k-1} e_{k-1,s-1} & \delta_{k-1} e_{k-1,s} \\
        e_{k,s-1}   & e_{k,s}
    \end{bmatrix}
    \begin{bmatrix}
        1-\lambda^+_s(y) \\
        \lambda^+_s(y)
    \end{bmatrix}
    \label{eq:multi_check_mean}
    \text{.}
\end{align}
%
Expanding the right-hand side yields
%
\begin{align}
    m_k(t,y)
    &=
    (1 - \lambda^+_k(t))(1 - \lambda^+_s(y)) \delta_{k-1} e_{k-1,s-1} \notag \\
    &\quad
    + (1 - \lambda^+_k(t)) \lambda^+_s(y) \delta_{k-1} e_{k-1,s} \notag \\
    &\quad
    + \lambda^+_k(t)(1 - \lambda^+_s(y)) e_{k,s-1} \notag \\
    &\quad
    + \lambda^+_k(t) \lambda^+_s(y) e_{k,s}
    \text{,}
\end{align}
%
which satisfies the conditions for the four check points,
%
\begin{align}
    m_k(t_{k-1}, y_{s-1}) &=  \delta_{k-1}e_{k-1,s-1} \text{,} \notag \\
    m_k(t_{k-1}, y_{s})   &=  \delta_{k-1}e_{k-1,s} \text{,} \notag \\
    m_k(t_{k}, y_{s-1})   &=  e_{k,s-1} \text{,} \notag \\
    m_k(t_{k}, y_{s})     &=  e_{k,s} \text{.}
\end{align}
%
To derive the conditional variance,
substitute the variance of the $y$-bridge
(Equation~\ref{eq:y_bridge_variance})
into the equation for a time bridge with uncertain endpoints
(Equation~\ref{eq:variance_uncertain_bridge})
%
\begin{align}
    \operatorname{Var}\left[
        E_{t,y}\,\mid\,
        \mathcal{C}
        \right]
    =  
    \underbrace{
        (1 - \lambda^+_k(t))^2 v_{k-1}(y)
        + \lambda^+_k(t)^2 v_k(y)
    }_{\tilde{v}_k(t,y)}
    + 
    \underbrace{\sigma^2_k \phi^+_k(t)}_{v_k(t)}
    \text{.}
\end{align}
%
Expanding $\tilde{v}_k(t,y)$ gives
%
\begin{equation}
    \tilde{v}_k(t,y) :=
        \left((1 - \lambda^+_k(t))^2,\; \lambda^+_k(t)^2\right)
        \begin{bmatrix}
            \operatorname{Var}[E_{k-1,s-1}] & \operatorname{Var}[E_{k-1,s}] \\
            \operatorname{Var}[E_{k,s-1}]   & \operatorname{Var}[E_{k,s}]
        \end{bmatrix}
        \begin{bmatrix}
            (1 - \lambda^+_s(y))^2 \\
            \lambda^+_s(y)^2
        \end{bmatrix}
        + \left((1 - \lambda^+_k(t))^2 + \lambda^+_k(t)^2\right)\eta^2 \phi^+_s(y)
    \label{eq:multi_check_variance}
    \text{,}
\end{equation}
%
which satisfies the four boundary conditions
%
\begin{align}
    \tilde{v}_k(t, y_{s-1})   &=    (1 - \lambda^+_k(t))^2 v_k(t_{k-1,s-1})
                                    + \lambda^+_k(t)^2 v_k(t_{k,s-1})
                                    + \sigma^2_k \phi^+_k(t)
                                    \text{,} \notag \\
    \tilde{v}_k(t, y_{s})     &=    (1 - \lambda^+_k(t))^2 v_k(t_{k-1,s})
                                    + \lambda^+_k(t)^2 v_k(t_{k,s})
                                    + \sigma^2_k \phi^+_k(t)
                                    \text{,} \notag \\
    \tilde{v}_k(t_{k-1}, y)   &=    (1 - \lambda^+_s(y))^2 v_k(t_{k-1,s-1})
                                    + \lambda^+_s(y)^2 v_k(t_{k-1,s})
                                    + \eta^2 \phi^+_s(y)
                                    \text{,} \notag \\
    \tilde{v}_k(t_{k}, y)     &=    (1 - \lambda^+_s(y))^2 v_k(t_{k,s-1}) 
                                    + \lambda^+_s(y)^2 v_k(t_{k,s})
                                    + \eta^2 \phi^+_s(y)
    \text{,}
\end{align}
%
each being a one-dimensional Gaussian bridge.

% Note that the standards need not be consistent between checks.

\section{Combined Error}

Recall that the fouling and calibration-drift variance has two components:
%
\begin{equation}
    \dot{v}_k := \operatorname{Var}\!\left[E_k\right] = v_k(t) + \tilde v_k(t)
    \text{,}
\end{equation}
%
where $v_k(t)$ is the variance from the error-process evolution 
and $\tilde v_k(t)$ is the additional variance from check-measurement uncertainty
(Equations~\ref{eq:check_variance} or \ref{eq:multi_check_variance}).

The combined conditional mean and variance are given by the sum of the individual components,
%
\begin{align}
m(t ,\, y) &=
    m_{f}(t ,\, y)
    +
    m_{d}(t ,\, y)
    \label{eq:total_mean}
    \qquad \text{and} \\
v(t ,\, y) &=
    \dot{v}_{f}(t ,\, y)
    +
    \dot{v}_{d}(t ,\, y)
    +
    v_{m}(y)
    \label{eq:total_variance}
    \text{,}
\end{align}
%
where $f$, $d$, and $m$ denote the fouling, drift, and measurement-noise components, respectively.
By definition, the mean of the measurement noise is zero ($m_m = 0$),
and the other means are given by Equations~
\ref{eq:unified_wiener_mean}
and
\ref{eq:multi_check_mean};
and the variances by Equations
\ref{eq:measurement_error},
\ref{eq:unified_wiener_variance},
\ref{eq:check_variance},
and
\ref{eq:multi_check_variance}.

\section{Corrected Measurement and Confidence Interval}

Recall that $m(t ,\, y)$ and $v(t ,\, y)$ give the expectation and variance of the error $E$ at $(t,y)$.
For the measurement model $Y = X + E$,
the bias-corrected estimate of the measurand $X$ is given by
%
\begin{equation}
    x(t ,\, y) = y - m(t ,\, y)
    \text{.}
\end{equation}
%
Since errors are conditionally Gaussian,
the approximate confidence interval is
%
\begin{equation}
    \mathrm{CI} = x(t ,\, y) \pm q_{1-\alpha/2}\sqrt{v(t ,\, y)}
    \text{,}
\end{equation}
%
where $q_{1-\alpha/2}$ is the $(1-\alpha/2)$ quantile
of the standard normal distribution.

\section{Parameter Estimation}

Let $r_k$ be the ``one-step-transition'' residual 
%
\begin{equation}
    r_k = e_k - m^o_k(t_k)
\end{equation}
and let $u_k$ be its conditional variance   
\begin{equation}
    u_k = v^o_k(t_k) + v_{k-1} + v_{k}
    \text{,}
\end{equation}
%
where $v_{k-1}$ and $v_{k}$ are the variances of the previous and current checks.

The drift rate $\mu_k$ and diffusion coefficient $\sigma_k$
are estimated by maximizing the Gaussian log-likelihood function
(omitting the additive constants),
%
\begin{equation}
    \ln \mathcal{L} (\mu_k, \sigma_k^2)
    =
    - \frac{1}{2} \sum_{k=1}^{K_i}
    \left[
        \log \left( u_k \right)
        +
        \frac{r_k^2}{u_k}
    \right]
    \text{.}
\end{equation}
%

For the special case of no observational uncertainty,
$v_k = v_r \equiv 0$,
the drift and diffusion parameters have closed-form maximum-likelihood estimators,
%
\begin{equation}
    \hat{\mu}_k = \frac{\sum_{k=1}^{K} e_k - \delta_{k-1} e_{k-1}}
                       {\sum_{k=1}^{K} (t_k - t_{k-1})}
\end{equation}
%
and
%
\begin{equation}
    \hat{\sigma}_k^2 = \frac{1}{K}{\sum_{k=1}^{K} \frac{r_k^2}{t_k - t_{k-1}}}
    \text{;}
\end{equation}
%
however, these become ill-conditioned when measurement uncertainty is significant,
because the denominator may approach zero while the residual term in the numerator does not.

For the multipoint calibration,
the residual and its variance are given by
%
\begin{align}
    r_{d,s} &= e_{d,s} - e_{d,s-1} \\
    u_{d,s} &= \eta^2 (z_{d,s} - z_{d,s-1})
                + v_{d,s} + v_{d,s-1}
    \text{,}
\end{align}
%
and the diffusion-rate parameter $\eta$
is estimated by maximizing the log-likelihood (omitting constants),
%
\begin{equation}
    \ln \mathcal{L} (\eta^2)
    =
    %-\frac{K_i}{2} \ln(2 \pi)
    - \frac{1}{2} \sum_{d=1}^{D} \sum_{s=2}^{S_d}
    \left[
        \log \left( u_{d,s} \right)
        +
        \frac{r_{d,s}^2}{u_{d,s}}
    \right]
    \text{,}
\end{equation}
%
where $S_d$ is the number of standards in the $d$-th calibration check,
because each check may use different standards.

This is necessary because in practice,
only some of the standards may be checked at a time.

Assuming no observational uncertainty,
$v_s = v_{s-1} \equiv 0$,
the maximum-likelihood estimator for $\eta$ is
%
\begin{equation}
    \hat{\eta}^2 =
    \frac{1}{N}
    \sum_{d=1}^{D} \sum_{s=2}^{S_d}
    \frac{\left(e_{d,s} - e_{d,s-1}\right)^2}
         {z_s - z_{s-1}}
    \text{,}
\end{equation}
%
where $N = \sum_{d=1}^{D} (S_d - 1)$.
This is better conditioned than $\hat{\sigma}$,
because calibration standards are typically separated in the $y$-dimension,
so the denominator never approaches zero.

\section{Monitoring Networks}

After deploying a measurement device,
several checks may be required before the drift and diffusion
parameters can be estimated reliably.
During this initial period, the estimates can be stabilized
by pooling information across similar devices in a monitoring network.
We propose using an empirical-Bayes approach with conjugate priors to obtain a closed-form shrinkage weight
that shrinks the individual estimate toward the network (population) mean.

Let $s_j$ be the diffusion estimate for device $j \in \{1,\ldots,J\}$,
and let $K_j$ be the number of checks for that particular device.

We assume an inverse-gamma prior on the diffusion rate,
%
\begin{equation}
    \sigma_j^2 \sim \operatorname{IG}(\kappa, \theta)
    \text{,}
\end{equation}
%
where $\kappa>0$ and $\theta>0$ are hyperparameters to be estimated from the data.
The prior density is
%
\begin{equation}
    p(\sigma^2 \mid \kappa,\theta)
    =
    \frac{\theta^\kappa}{\Gamma(\kappa)} (\sigma^2)^{-(\kappa+1)}\exp\left(-\frac{\theta}{\sigma^2}\right)
    \text{,}
\end{equation}
%
and prior mean $\mathbb{E}[\sigma^2]=\theta/(\kappa-1)$ for $\kappa>1$.

Integrating out $\sigma_j^2$ gives the marginal likelihood for $(\kappa,\theta)$,
which, up to an additive constant, is
%
\begin{equation}
    \ln \mathcal{L} (s \mid \kappa,\theta)
    =
    \sum_{j=1}^{J}
    \left(
        \kappa\ln(\theta)
        + \ln \Gamma\left(\kappa + \frac{K_j}{2}\right)
        - \ln \Gamma(\kappa)
        - \left(\kappa + \frac{K_j}{2}\right)\ln\left(\theta + \frac{K_j s_j^2}{2}\right)
    \right)
    \text{.}
    \label{eq:hierarchical_likelihood}
\end{equation}
%
Empirical-Bayes estimates $\hat{\kappa}$ and $\hat{\theta}$ can be obtained by maximizing
Equation~\ref{eq:hierarchical_likelihood}.

Given hyperparameters $(\kappa,\theta)$, the posterior for $\sigma_j^2$ is
$\operatorname{IG}\bigl(\kappa + K_j/2,\; \theta + K_j s_j^2/2\bigr)$,
so the posterior mean (for $\kappa+K_j/2>1$) is
%
\begin{equation}
    \mathbb{E}[\sigma_j^2 \mid s_j^2,\kappa,\theta]
    =
    \frac{\theta + \tfrac{K_j}{2}s_j^2}{\kappa + \tfrac{K_j}{2} - 1}
    =
    w_j\,s_j^2 + (1-w_j)\,\bar{\sigma}^2
    \text{,}
\end{equation}
%
where
%
\begin{equation}
    \bar{\sigma}^2 := \frac{\theta}{\kappa-1}
    \text{,} \qquad
    w_j := \frac{K_j}{K_j + 2(\kappa-1)}
    \text{.}
\end{equation}
%
Substituting $(\hat{\kappa},\hat{\theta})$ gives the empirical-Bayes shrinkage estimate
%
\begin{equation}
    \hat{\sigma}_j^2
    =
    \hat{w}_j\,s_j^2 + (1-\hat{w}_j)\,\bar{\hat{\sigma}}^2
    \text{,}
    \qquad
    \hat{w}_j := \frac{K_j}{K_j + 2(\hat{\kappa}-1)}
    \text{.}
\end{equation}
%

For the drift rate, we assume a Gaussian prior,
%
\begin{equation}
    \mu_j \sim \mathcal{N}(\nu, \tau^2)
    \text{,}
\end{equation}
%
where $\nu$ and $\tau^2$ are the population hyperparameters,
which have closed-form maximum-likelihood estimators
%
\begin{align}
    \hat{\nu} &= \frac{\sum_{j=1}^{J} K_j \hat{\mu}_j}{\sum_{j=1}^{J} K_j} \\
    \hat{\tau}^2 &= \frac{\sum_{j=1}^{J} K_j (\hat{\mu}_j - \hat{\nu})^2}{\sum_{j=1}^{J} K_j}
    \text{,}
\end{align}

Given hyperparameters $(\nu,\tau^2)$ and assuming the sampling variance of $\hat{\mu}_j$ is $\sigma_j^2/K_j$,
the posterior mean of $\mu_j$ is
%
\begin{equation}
    \mathbb{E}[\mu_j \mid \hat{\mu}_j,\nu,\tau^2]
    =
    \frac{\tau^{-2}\nu + K_j\sigma_j^{-2}\hat{\mu}_j}{\tau^{-2} + K_j\sigma_j^{-2}}
    =
    u_j\,\hat{\mu}_j + (1-u_j)\,\nu
    \text{,}
\end{equation}
%
where the shrinkage weight is
%
\begin{equation}
    u_j := \frac{K_j\sigma_j^{-2}}{\tau^{-2} + K_j\sigma_j^{-2}}
    =
    \frac{K_j\tau^2}{K_j\tau^2 + \sigma_j^2}
    \text{.}
\end{equation}
%
Substituting $(\hat{\nu},\hat{\tau}^2,\hat{\sigma}_j^2)$ gives the empirical-Bayes shrinkage estimate
%
\begin{equation}
    \tilde{\mu}_j
    =
    \hat{u}_j\,\hat{\mu}_j + (1-\hat{u}_j)\,\hat{\nu}
    \text{,}
    \qquad
    \hat{u}_j := \frac{K_j\hat{\tau}^2}{K_j\hat{\tau}^2 + \hat{\sigma}_j^2}
    \text{.}
\end{equation}

In practice, per-device estimates for
$(\hat{\sigma}_j^2$, $\hat{w}_j$, $\tilde{\mu}_j$, and $\hat{u}_j)$
can be recomputed after each check,
whereas the population hyperparameters $(\hat{\kappa},\hat{\theta},\hat{\nu},\hat{\tau}^2)$
may be updated less frequently.
The main limitation of our Empirical-Bayes approach is that
the inverse-gamma prior is known to be suboptimal \citep{Gelman_2006}.
Nevertheless, its closed-form shrinkage estimator is advantageous for large, real-time monitoring networks.
Otherwise, each new check measurement incurs a significant computational cost.

\section{Data Requirements}

Implementing the bias-correction framework requires the following information.

\conclusions  %% \conclusions[modified heading if necessary]

Environmental timeseries are routinely affected by fouling and calibration drift,
which cause systematic bias.
In practice, the measurement device must be periodically checked
against known references, cleaned, and recalibrated.
Later, these check measurements are used to correct the timeseries
by interpolating between the errors observed at each check.
Here, we formalize this correction procedure as a stochastic model
to derive confidence intervals for the corrected timeseries.
We also extend the model to multipoint calibrations
and to pooling information across monitoring networks of similar devices.

% \appendix

% \noappendix       %% use this to mark the end of the appendix section. Otherwise the figures might be numbered incorrectly (e.g. 10 instead of 1).

%% Regarding figures and tables in appendices, the following two options are possible depending on your general handling of figures and tables in the manuscript environment:

%% Option 1: If you sorted all figures and tables into the sections of the text, please also sort the appendix figures and appendix tables into the respective appendix sections.
%% They will be correctly named automatically.

%% Option 2: If you put all figures after the reference list, please insert appendix tables and figures after the normal tables and figures.
%% To rename them correctly to A1, A2, etc., please add the following commands in front of them:

\appendixfigures  %% needs to be added in front of appendix figures

\appendixtables   %% needs to be added in front of appendix tables

%% Please add \clearpage between each table and/or figure. Further guidelines on figures and tables can be found below.
