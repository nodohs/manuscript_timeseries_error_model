In a measuring device 
In practice, deterimination of these errors is used to correct the raw measurements
Later on, these 

% USGS operates a network of several thousands of such devices
% so a flexible approach

\subsection{Preliminaries}
%
Let $x$ be the true value of some variable,
$y$ be a measurement of $x$,
such that the absolute error $e$ is the difference between the two,
%
\begin{equation}
    e = y - x
    \text{,}
\end{equation}
%
or error may be more accurately represented in relative terms,
%
\begin{equation}
    \%e = 100 \times \frac{y - x}{x}
    \text{,}
\end{equation}
%
given as a percentage of the true value.
Either form may used to estimate an uncertainty interval,
depending on the properties of the measurement device.

Furthermore, we assume each measurement comprises three types of error:
fouling $e_f$,
calibration drift $e_d$,
and the innate precision of the measuring device $e_p$,
which sum to the total,
%
\begin{equation}
    e = e_f + e_d + e_p
    \text{.}
\end{equation}
%
Fouling results from some physical, chemical, or biological buildup 
that interferes with the measurement.
The magnitude of fouling is determined by taking check
measurements before and after cleaning the measurement device.
Under steady-state conditions, the fouling error is given by
%
\begin{equation}
    e_f = y_a - y_b
\end{equation}
%
where $y_a$ is the measurement after cleaning,
and $y_b$ is the measurement before cleaning.
Otherwise, the error must account for any changes
in the environment during the cleaning,
%
\begin{equation}
    e_f = (y_a - y_b) - (z_a - z_b)
    \qquad \text{or} \qquad
    \%e_f = 100 \times \frac{(y_a - y_b) - (z_a - z_b)}{y_b}
    \label{eq:fouling_error}
\end{equation}
%
where $z_a$ and $z_b$ are measurements from a reference device in the same
environment \citep{Wagner_2006}.


Calibration drift results from any electronic (or mechanical) drift
in accuracy since the measurement device was last calibrated;
in other words, any residual bias after cleaning the device.
The magnitude of calibration-drift is determined by comparing a clean measurement
against a known standard $z_s$,
%
\begin{equation}
    e_d = y_s - z_s
    \qquad \text{or} \qquad
    \%e_{d} = 100 \times \frac{z_s - y_s}{y_s}
    \text{.}
    \label{eq:drift_error}
\end{equation}
%
where $z_s$ is the standard value,
and $y_s$ is its measurement of $z_s$ \citep{Wagner_2006}.

Lastly, precision error $e_p$ results from the inherent inaccuracy of any measurement device.
% not affected by fouling or drift.
In practice, precision is determined under controlled laboratory conditions
and is approximated with a normal distribution,
%
\begin{equation}
    e_p \sim \mathcal{N}\left(0, \% \sigma^2_p \right)
    \qquad \text{or} \qquad
    \%e_{p} \sim \mathcal{N}\left(0, \% \sigma^2_{p} \right)
    \text{.}
    \label{eq:precision_error}
\end{equation}
%
In many cases, precision is determined by the manufacturer
and reported among the device specifications
(often reported as "accuracy").
For example,
an accuracy of $\pm 0.1$ units or $\pm 2$\% of reading,
usually corresponds to the $2\sigma$ or 95\% confidence interval,
such that $\sigma_p$ is half the reported value.
%$e_p \sim \mathcal{N}\left(0, 0.05^2 \right)$
Though not a requirement,
we often assume fouling and drift errors have the same
form---absolute or relative---as the precision.

\subsection{The Measurement Procedure}

A clean and calibrated device is deployed into the environment to measure some variable of interest.
As time passes, fouling and calibration-drift errors accumulate,
which bias the raw measurements.
To correct for that bias,
the fouling and calibration are periodically checked.
Any check might determine one or both errors,
and may or may not involve cleaning or recalibrating the device.
After the check,
the raw time series measurements should be corrected to account for any fouling and calibration error,
typically, by assuming the error grows at a constant rate between checks \citep{Wagner_2006}.
Reality can be more complicated, but for simplicity,
we will extend this same assumption as a basis for modeling the uncertainty.

\subsection{Wiener Process}

In order to estimate the uncertainty of the corrected measurement,
we will assume that the drift and fouling errors
follow a Wiener process with an optional drift term $\mu$.
%not to be confused with the calibration drift.
Formally, a Wiener process is a continuous-time stochastic process
for which the increments are independent and normally distributed,
with variance proportional to the time elapsed,
and a drift term representing the average rate of change over time
(with $\mu=0$ for a classical Wiener process).
The drift term is important when a device exhibits a systematic bias over time,
such as the gradual degradation of some consumable element.

Let $E_t$ be a random variable representing the error at time $t$,
and $e_t$ be its realization (observed value).
Suppose we observe the error at times $0 = t_0 < t_1 < t_2 < \cdots < t_K = T$,
with $E_{t_k} = e_k$ for $k = 0, 1, \ldots, K$.
Thus, $t_k - t_{k-1}$ represents the time elapsed between subsequent observations
$e_{k-1}$ and $e_k$.
The subscript $k$ serves a place holder for either fouling $f$ or drift $d$ throughout.
For example, $\lambda_f(t)$ will denotes the fouling weight for $t \in \left[t_{f-1}, t_f \right]$.

%Following the last observation at time $t_k-1$,
%Assuming the error process 
First, consider the case after observing the error at time $t_{k-1}$,
but before observing the error at time $t_k$
%($t \in [t_{k-1}, t_k)$).
% ($t_{k-1} \le t < t_k$).
We refer to this as an open interval,
which occurs during real-time estimation of the measurement uncertainty.
In contrast, a closed interval is bracketed by observations at $t_{k-1}$ and $t_k$,
and the conditional mean and variance are revised accordingly.
Pratically speaking,
our initial real-time estimate needs to be revised after observing the next error.

For an open interval,
we assume the conditional distribution
of $E_t$ follows a Wiener process with drift,
%
\begin{equation}
    p(e_t \mid E_{k-1} = e_{k-1})
    =
    \mathcal{N}(\delta_{k-1}  e_{k-1} + \mu t ,\; \sigma^2 t)
    \text{,} \qquad
    \delta_{k-1} =
    \begin{cases}
        0, & \text{reset} \\
        1, & \text{otherwise}
    \end{cases}
\end{equation}
%
%
%\begin{equation}
%    E_{t} \mid E_0 = e_0 \sim \mathcal{N}(e_0 + \mu t ,\; \sigma^2 t) \text{,}
%    \label{eq:wiener_process}
%\end{equation}
%
where
$\delta_{k-1}$ is a binary variable indicating whether the error process has been reset
due to cleaning or recalibration,
$e_{k-1}$ is the error at time $t_{k-1}$,
%$\mathcal{N}$ is the normal distribution
%specified by its mean and variance,
$\mu$ is the drift rate (mean change per unit time),
$\sigma^2$ is the instantaneous variance rate (variance per unit time).
Thus for any $t \ge 0$,
it follows that the conditional mean and variance of $E_t$ are
%
\begin{align}
    \mathbb{E}\left[E_t \mid E_{k-1}
        &= e_{k-1} \right] = \delta_{k-1} e_{k-1} + \mu t
        \text{,} \\
    \text{Var}\left(E_t \mid E_{k-1}
        &= e_{k-1} \right) = \sigma^2 t
    \text{.}
\end{align}
%
%
Later on, upon observing the error at time $t_k$,
we update the conditional distribution of $E_t$ to include that new information.
A Wiener process conditioned to start and end at specified values
is known as a Brownian bridge.
%For any interval $\left[t_{k-1}, t_k \right]$,
%the conditioned error process $E_t \mid E_{t_{k-1}} = e_{k-1}, E_{t_k} = e_k$ is a Brownian bridge.
To simplify notation, 
let $\lambda(t)$ be the linear interpolation weight,
%
\begin{equation}
    \lambda_k(t) = \frac{t - t_{k-1}}{t_k - t_{k-1}}
    \text{,} \qquad
    t \in \left[t_{k-1}, t_k \right]
    \text{,}
\end{equation}
%
%Using $\lambda_k(t)$,
then the conditional distribution of the error process at time $t$ is given by
%
\begin{equation}
    p(e_t \mid E_{t_{k-1}} = e_{k-1},\; E_{t_k} = e_k)
    =
    \mathcal{N} \left(
        \delta_{k-1} \left( 1 - \lambda(t) \right)e_{k-1}
        + 
        \lambda(t) e_k,\;
        \sigma^2 (1 - \lambda(t)) \lambda(t) (t_k - t_{k-1})
    \right)
    \text{,}
\end{equation}
where $t \in \left[t_{k-1}, t_k \right]$,
and the conditional mean and variance are
%
\begin{align}
    \mathbb{E}\left[ E_t \mid E_{t_{k-1}} = e_{k-1} ,\; E_{t_k} = e_k \right]
        &=
        \delta_{k-1} \left( 1 - \lambda(t) \right) e_{k-1} + \lambda(t) e_k
        \text{,}
        \label{eq:wiener_bridge_mean} \\
    \text{Var} \left(E_t \mid E_{t_{k-1}} = e_{k-1} ,\; E_{t_k} = e_k \right)
        &= \sigma^2 (1 - \lambda(t)) \; \lambda(t) (t_k - t_{k-1})
        \qquad \text{or} \\
        &= \sigma^2 \frac{(t - t_{k-1})(t_{k} - t)}{t_{k} - t_{k-1}} 
        \label{eq:wiener_bridge_variance}
\end{align}
%

\subsection{Total variance}
%
\begin{align}
v_{total}(t) =
    v_{f}(t)
    +
    v_{d}(t)
    +
    \sigma^2_{p}
    \lambda_{d}(t)
    \chi_{d}(t)
    \label{eq:total_variance_closed}
\end{align}
where $\chi_{d}$ is a binary function equal to 1 if $t \neq t_{d}$ and 0 otherwise,
\begin{equation}
\chi_{d}(t) =
\begin{cases}
    1, & t \neq t_{d} \\
    0, & t = t_{d}
\end{cases}
\label{eq:chi_function}
\end{equation}


and the subscripts $f$, $d$, and $p$ refer to fouling, drift, and precision components, respectively.

The $\chi_{d}(t)$ term represents the indirect effect of the instrument precision.


The total error variance during an open interval $o$ at time $t$ is given by
%
\begin{equation}
v_o(t) =
    \left(t - t_{f-1}\right) \sigma^2_{f}
    +
    \left(t - t_{d-1}\right) \sigma^2_{d}
    +
    \sigma^2_{p}
    \text{,}
    \label{eq:total_variance_open} 
\end{equation}
%
y is our measurement, then the expected value of x at time t is
\begin{equation}
    \mathbb{E}\left[X_t \mid y_t ,\; e_F ,\; e_D \right]
    =
    y_t - m_f(t) - m_d(t)
\end{equation}
and the confidence interval is approximately
\begin{equation}
    \pm z_{\alpha/2} \sqrt{v(t)}
    	ext{,}
\end{equation}
where $z_{\alpha/2}$ is the $(1-\alpha/2)$ quantile of the standard normal distribution
(e.g., $z_{0.025} = 1.96$ for a 95\% confidence interval).

Similarly for relative error,
\begin{equation}
    \mathbb{E}\left[X_t \mid y_t ,\; e_F ,\; e_D \right]
    =
    y_t \left(1 - \frac{m_f(t) + m_d(t)}{100} \right)
\end{equation}
and the confidence interval is approximately
\begin{equation}
    \pm y_t \frac{z_{\alpha/2} \sqrt{v(t)}}{100}
    	ext{.}
\end{equation}
